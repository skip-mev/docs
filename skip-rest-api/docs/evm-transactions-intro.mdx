title: "EVM Transactions Intro"
description: "This doc covers how to interact with the EvmTx type returned by the Skip API (/fungible/msgs + /fungible/msgs_direct)"
---

## Intro

* When a user needs to transfer or swap from an EVM chain (e.g. Ethereum mainnet, Arbitrum, Optimism, etc...), the Skip API will return an `EvmTx` type for the developer to pass to the user for signing
* Unlike CosmosSDK transactions, EVM transactions do not have a notion of messages, so this object doesn't correspond 1-to-1 to a "message", which might be a more familiar notion to Cosmos developers
* This doc is intended for CosmosSDK developers who aren't already familiar with the concepts of transaction construction in the EVM and need to use `EvmTx` to help their users move from/to EVM chains.

## `EvmTx` Data Structure

The EvmTx has 4 fields that the developer needs to understand: 

* `to`: The address of the smart contract or externally owned account (EOA) with which this transaction interacts, as a hex-string prefixed with 0x (e.g.
* `value`: The amount of `wei` this transaction sends to the contract its interacting with (1 ether = 1^18 wei)
* `data`: The calldata this transaction uses to call the smart contract it interacts with, as a hex string. The data bytes will be interpreted according to the application-binary-interface (ABI) of the contract that's being interacted with. If this field is empty, it means the transaction is sending funds to an address, rather than calling a contract.
* `required_erc20_approvals`: The permissions that must be granted to a specific smart contract to spend or transfer a certain amount of their ERC-20 tokens on behalf of the end user. This allows smart contracts to execute expressive flows that may involve moving some amount of the user's ERC-20 tokens  
   * If this field is non-empty, the approval must be granted, signed, and submitted before the `EvmTx` populated by the other fields in the response can be submitted to the network. Otherwise, it will fail to execute  
   * Skip's `ERC20Approval` object has 3 fields that define approval:  
         * `token_contract`: The address of the ERC-20 token on which the approval is granted  
         * `spender`: The address of the contract to which the approval will grant spend authority  
         * `amount`: The amount of `token_contract` tokens the approval will grant the `spender` to spend  
   * Check out EIP-2612 for more information on ERC-20 approvals.
* `chain_id`: This is the same as in the Cosmos context (simply an identifier for the chain), but it's an int instead of a string

## Set up Signing Library

To enable EVM transactions in your application, first install an EVM developer library. The most popular options are:

* [viem](https://viem.sh/)
* [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/)
* [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.10.0/)

The code snippets below use viem. 

## Create a signer object

Both libraries allow you to create "signer" objects that: 

* Use an RPC provider under the hood to query the chain for necessary data to create transactions (e.g. nonce, gas price, etc...)
* Expose an API that allows constructing, signing, and broadcasting transactions

You need to initialize one of these before you can grant approvals or sign other kinds of transactions. 

For example, with Viem, we do the folllowing: 

```TypeScript TypeScript
import { createWalletClient, http, publicActions } from 'viem'
import { mainnet } from 'viem/chains'

const account = privateKeyToAccount('0x...')

const client = createWalletClient({
  account,
  chain: mainnet,
  transport: http()
}).extend(publicActions)
```

## Granting approvals

If your transaction requires an approval (see above), grant it before asking the user to sign their EVM transaction. 

In Viem, the whole process of granting an approval given a response from the Skip API `/fungible/messages` or `/fungible/messages_direct` endpoint looks like: 

```TypeScript TypeScript
// iterating over approvals in the EvmTx
for (const requiredApproval of message.requiredERC20Approvals){
  // reading the contract of the ERC20 token to figure out whether the user already has 
  // granted at least the necessary approval
  const allowance = await extendedSigner.readContract({
    address: requiredApproval.tokenContract as `0x${string}`,
    abi: erc20ABI,
    functionName: "allowance",
    args: [
      signer.account.address as `0x${string}`,
      requiredApproval.spender as `0x${string}`,
    ],
  });
	// not requesting a new approval if its already been granted in the past
  if (allowance > BigInt(requiredApproval.amount)) {
    continue;
  }

  // constructing the approval
  const txHash = await extendedSigner.writeContract({
    account: signer.account,
    address: requiredApproval.tokenContract as `0x${string}`,
    abi: erc20ABI,
    functionName: "approve",
    args: [requiredApproval.spender as `0x${string}`, maxUint256],
    chain: signer.chain,
  });

  const receipt = await extendedSigner.waitForTransactionReceipt({
    hash: txHash,
  });

  if (receipt.status === "reverted") {
    throw new Error(`EVM tx reverted: ${receipt.transactionHash}`);
  }
}
```

## Constructing and signing transactions

Once the approval has been granted, use the rest of the fields in the EvmTx object to construct, sign and broadcast the necessary EVM transaction to kick off the flow. 

In viem, we use the signer's `sendTransaction` function:

```TypeScript TypeScript
const txHash = await extendedSigner.sendTransaction({
    account: signer.account,
    to: message.to as `0x${string}`,
    data: `0x${message.data}`,
    chain: signer.chain,
    value: message.value === "" ? undefined : BigInt(message.value),
});
```
