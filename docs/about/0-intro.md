### Sovereign Transaction Infrastructure for Sovereign Blockchains

Skip helps sovereign blockchains and frontends improve UX and leverage MEV to enrich network stakeholders and protect them from its harmful effects.

# What does Skip offer?

### 🧱 For Chains

Skip builds an open-source [Block SDK](/docs/chains/blocksdk/1-overview.md) that allows for full control over how blocks are built, including a MEV recapture mechanism, a sovereign Oracle, and segmentation to tailor blocks to your app-chain use case.

Used by the majority of major Cosmos SDK chains, we recommend the [Block SDK](/docs/chains/blocksdk/0-integrate-the-sdk.md) for any chains running Cosmos SDK version 0.47 or higher.
Integration takes < 20 mins, and please [contact us](https://skip.money/contact) if you need assistance.

We also built Slinky(/docs/chains/slinky/0-overview.md), an enshrined oracle that integrates with Cosmos chains using ABCI++ to provide a simple, secure, and reliable way to post data on-chain.
If you're interested in integrating Slinky into your chain please [contact us](https://skip.money/contact).

### 🥷 For Searchers

On both chains that use Skip V1 and V2, searchers can participate in capturing MEV and bidding in the top-of-block auction for atomic execution. Check out our searcher docs for Skip [V1](/docs/select/2-searcher.md) and [V2](/docs/0-searcher-docs.md).

### 👩‍💻 For Frontends

Frontends in the IBC ecosystem can dramatically improve their UX by using the free [Skip APIs](https://api-docs.skip.money/docs). See the docs for how to get set up!
