It takes just 5 minutes to start using Skip Select to capture MEV with your validator. Even less on chains that include `mev-tendermint` by default.

## Summary of Steps

**Estimated Time**: 5 mins

1. Register as a validator on [skip.money/registration](http://skip.money/registration) to receive an API key
2. Compile your node binaries with `mev-tendermint` (if mev-tendermint is not included in the chain binary by default)
3. Add 3-4 lines of additional config to your nodes
4. Restart your nodes ðŸš€

## 1. Register âœ…

**ðŸš¨**Â  If you donâ€™t already have an API Key, please get one from the [Skip registration site](https://skip.money/registration).

You will need access to your operator key or a key to which your operator has delegated a `MsgVote` authorization to register. See [these instructions](./6-api-key.md) for how to a `MsgVote` authorization if you're not comfortable using your operator key from a browser wallet.

ðŸ’µÂ **After registering, you can also use the Skip web app to configure your MEV payments between you / network stakers on the site.**

## 2. Compile your node with `mev-tendermint`

**THIS STEP IS ONLY REQUIRED IF YOUR CHAIN DOES NOT INCLUDE `mev-tendermint` BY DEFAULT.**

We provide forks of the source code for all the open source chains we support at https://github.com/skip-mev that come pre-loaded with mev-tendermint _and no other modifications_.

:::caution Not applicable for Injective
Because the Injective codebase is not open source, Injective requires a different process. You must follow the special Injective instructions [here](./8-injective-build.md). (Don't worry, they're simple.)
:::

1. Set `SKIP_CHAIN_REPO` to the name of the fork of the chain you're building:

- **EVMOS:** `export SKIP_CHAIN_REPO=evmos`
- **JUNO:** `export SKIP_CHAIN_REPO=juno`
- **Terra2:** `export SKIP_CHAIN_REPO=terra-core`
- **Comdex:** `export SKIP_CHAIN_REPO=comdex`

2. Clone the appropriate fork and enter the directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/skip-mev/$SKIP_CHAIN_REPO
cd $SKIP_CHAIN_REPO
```

3. Determine the current version of the chain binary using the official chain documentation or Skip's documentation [here](../3-chain-configuration.md). and checkout the corresponding `-mev` tag:

```bash
git checkout $CHAIN_VERSION-mev
```

4. Build the binary as normal using `make install`

:::note Example
For example, if we were building v10.0.1 of EVMOS, the process would look like:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/skip-mev/evmos
cd evmos
git checkout v10.0.1-mev
make install
```

:::

5. Repeat this process for all of your full nodes, including if you use Horcrux.

:::info Alternative methods
Read more about other methods that do not require forking our repos [here](./5-alternatives.md) if you would prefer to use the official chain repo and inject `mev-tendermint` yourself
:::

## 3. Update config.toml

`mev-tendermint` introduces a new section of config in `config.toml` called `[sidecar]` that includes several
config settings that allow your node to recieve MEV bundles from Skip.

(You can read more about what these are here: [Validator Config Reference Docs](./3-config.md))

By the end, the end of your `config.toml` on each node will look something like this (with different string values). **Make sure to include the line `[sidecar]` at the top of this section in `config.toml`.**

```yaml
# OTHER CONFIG...

# EXAMPLE below (please use the correct values)
[sidecar]
sentinel_peer_string = "fakepeerid@fake_network_id-sentinel.skip.money:26656"
sentinel_rpc_string = "http://fake_network_id.skip.money"
api_key = "fake_api_key"
```

- For `api_key`, use the value you obtained by registering for Skip Select in the first step.

- **Find the correct values for sentinel_peer_string and sentinel_rpc_string in the table below:**

### Extra config for sentry configurations

**Skip this section if you don't use full node sentries, or, equivalently, if you'd like all of your nodes to gossip directly to the sentinel.**

These steps are only relevant for folks with set ups where they want one of their nodes to not peer with the Sentinel (e.g. a full signing node with sentries) and instead receive MEV bundles through an intermediary node (e.g. a sentry node)

- **On the sentry nodes:**

  - Add an **extra line** to the `[sidecar]` config called **`personal_peer_ids`**, and add the node id for your **validator**

  ```yaml
  [sidecar];
  sentinel_peer_string =
    "fake-node-id@fake-network-id-sentinel.skip.money:26656";
  sentinel_rpc_string = "http://fake-network-id-api.skip.money";
  api_key = "fake-api-key";
  personal_peer_ids = "NODEID1,NODEID2, ...";
  ```

  â†’ You can find your node ids by running:

  ```bash
  <NODE_DAEMON> tendermint show-node-id --home <HOME_DIR>

  # example:
  junod tendermint show-node-id --home ./juno
  ```

- **On the validator:**

  - **Remove** the line for `sentinel_peer_string`
  - **Remove** the line for `sentinel_rpc_string`
  - **Remove** the line for `api_key`
  - Add an **extra line** to the `[sidecar]` config called **`personal_peer_ids`**, and add the node ids for your **sentry nodes**

  ```jsx
  [sidecar];
  personal_peer_ids = "NODEID1,NODEID2, ...";
  ```

  â†’ You can find your node ids by running:

  ```jsx
  <NODE_DAEMON> tendermint show-node-id --home <HOME_DIR>

  # example:
  junod tendermint show-node-id --home ./juno
  ```

---

## 4. Restart your node ðŸš€

**Thatâ€™s it!** You should now begin receiving MEV bundles and higher rewards from Skip âœ…

**If you use Cosmovisor, make sure to point it to the new binary**

**Run `curl -sL localhost:26657/status | jq .result.mev_info` to check if you are connected**

- If things are working correctly you should see this:

  ```jsx
  {
    "is_peered_with_sentinel": true,
    "last_received_bundle_height": "0"
  }
  ```

- **Troubleshooting**: If you aren't receiving the expected output, please visit the [troubleshooting page](./1-troubleshooting.md) or get in touch with Skip team for assistance.

- **Monitoring:** mev-tendermint exposes new Prometheus metrics under the "mev" namespace in tendermint.
  The most important metric is `mev_sentinel_connected`, which is 1 if your node is able to receive MEV transactions
  from Skip, and 0 otherwise. Check out [this page](./2-monitoring.md) for more information on monitoring and alerting solutions

### Handling Chain Upgrades

Skip does not make chain upgrades more complex.

Simply follow the instructions from [step 2 above](#2-compile-your-node-with-mev-tendermint) each time you need to upgrade a node, using the new `$CHAIN_VERSION-mev` tag.
