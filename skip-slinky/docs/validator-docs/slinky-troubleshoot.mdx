## Troubleshooting FAQs
We are in the process of building up our core documentation around operational issues and troubleshooting. For now, we are available 24/7 for any questions. The fastest way to reach us is by emailing support@skip.money

## Can I run Slinky on the same machine as my validator?
Yes, you can run it anywhere - but please defer to any chain-specific reccommendations if there are any!

## Can I get slashed for running Slinky?
Not usually. If a chain uses Slinky and requires oracle prices to be posted, running the Slinky sidecar is the best way to avoid downtime or incorrect prices. For more information, check out the [Incentivization Docs](/slinky/incentivize-slashing).

Many chains will reward good operation of Slinky with additional validator yield, make sure to ask the team!

## Does Slinky take up a lot of resources?
No, it's a very lightweight binary.

## ## Can I contribute to Slinky?
Yes - feel free to contribute via opening an issue in our [repo](https://github.com/skip-mev/docs)!
